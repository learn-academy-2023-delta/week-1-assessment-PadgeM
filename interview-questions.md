# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement is the if and else statements which make the code work in an interesting way. If you need to do multiple things within a function you would use and if and else statements. An example of this would be like if this is true then do this, else do this. You can expand on this using the else if statements as well. 

Researched answer: Conditional statements alter JavaScripts behavior. They determine whether some pieces of code can run and if others can not. There are multiple conditionals in JavaScript. They have the "if" statement where if a condition is true then it will execute the function. There are the "Else" statement which catches if the condition is false then it will execute this block of code. Then there is the "Else if" statement which tells the code if the condition before it is false then execute this block of code but this can be false and move to the "Else" statement.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: So I think git is the program used to handle the whatever languages that you need to send to github. git is the local computer and Github is the cloud where you code can reside.

Researched answer: Git is a version control tool that can help manage a devs project source code history. It is a open source tool that we can install locally to take care of our code. Github is a online website that was made for developers who use Git to upload their code or download resources for whatever coding projects they are working on.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The === will return a boolean value. A boolean is a true or false statement. We also have the || which is the OR operator.  Then we have the && which is the AND operator.

Researched answer: I have found that there are multiple operators that will return a boolean operator. We have the comparison operators which are `==`, `===`, `!=`, `!==`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`. Then we have the logical operators which are the logical AND operator `&&`, and the logical OR `||` and finally we have the logical NOT `!`. The last batch of operators we have that return a boolean will be the conditional operators `? :`.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The difference between an array's index and its value is this. The value is the data that sits at whichever index. The index tells you the spot that item or data is sitting. Whereas the value is the data itself.

Researched answer: So in JavaScript the difference between an array's index and its value, an array is an ordered list or collection of values that can be accessed using their index. Every value within that index can be searched by their unique index, this is their position in the array.  The position of every index starts from zero and goes up the length of the array minus one. The value of an array is the actual data stored in the array. Each value in the array can be of any data type this can include strings, numbers, objects, or other arrays. 

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming would be having a driver and navigator. One person codes while the other helps that person with the same code. This way you have two heads rather than one to look at the code and see whatever problems that might arise and hopefully solve them faster and more efficiently than alone. 
The roles of each person are this, the driver is the coder. They are the only ones with their hands on the keyboard driving the code. Then there is the navigator, their whole job is to support the driver in making good code.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development method in which two developers work together on the same codebase, sharing a single workstation. The goal of pair programming is to improve code quality, knowledge transfer, and team collaboration. Proper pair programming techniques can involve following the specific roles and proper practices to ensure that both developers are effectively contributing to the process.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions is a function that either accepts a function as an argument or returns a function as a result.

2. Jest: This is a JavaScript testing framework that is used to test JavaScript code and Node.js applications. Jest provides an interface for writing, executing tests, and includes features such as test suites, test cases, assertions, and mocking. 

3. Objects: Theses are data structures that are used to store collections of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces, or using the object constructor function. Objects can have properties, which are the keys in the key-value pairs, and methods, which are functions that are associated with the object and can be called using the dot notations. 

4. Method: This is a function that is associated with an object and can be called using the dot notation. method's are defined as properties of an object, and can be called on that object using the object dot notation. Methods are usually used for performing operations on the data stored in the object, or to interact with the environment in which the object is running.

5. Classes: Classes are a way of defining objects that include data and behavior. They are defined using the class keyword, and can include properties and methods. They can be used to create objects that share common properties and behavior, and can be extended to create new classes that inherit properties and behavior from the parent class.
